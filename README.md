# 🎧 Audio Noise Reduction using Digital Signal Processing

This is my first DSP mini-project where I generated audio, added noise, 
and reduced it using a Butterworth Low-Pass Filter in Python.

### 🔍 What this project does
- Generates synthetic audio
- Adds random noise
- Applies Butterworth Low-Pass Filtering
- Plots waveform and spectrogram
- Shows clear improvement in audio quality

### 🛠 Tech Used
Python, NumPy, SciPy, Librosa, Matplotlib
